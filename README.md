# Emotion_Analysis_Music-Lyrics

## Project Overview 
 
This project explores the alignment of emotions between music and lyrics by leveraging MuLan embeddings, a joint audio-language embedding model. By mapping music audio and natural language descriptions into a shared embedding space, MuLan enables us to capture semantic and emotional similarities across modalities. Our aim is to analyze and visualize the emotional alignment between music and lyrics.
